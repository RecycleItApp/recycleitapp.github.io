            <div id="panel1a" class="content active">
              recycle.it is an application that locates the nearest recycling locations for a variety of items.  in commercial applications it uses barcodes and RFID tags to help municipalities, property managers, homeowners or tenants track their recycling.  It is designed to make the recycling process as easy as possible and because each item generates points it is designed to foster competition between users. This is the gamification of recycling.

            <a href="#panel2a">How does recycle.it work? </a>
            <div id="panel2a" class="content">
              When locations services is turned on recycle.it tells users where the closest recycling location taking the “I have no idea where to take this” factor away.

              Tenants scan a barcode on a recycling bin in their building to check-in each time they recycle paper, metal, glass, plastic or other materials. For each check-in they receive points which they use to compete against others or earn incentives. 

              Property managers and homeowners add an RFID tag to each bag of recyclables. Each time they scan a bag their property earns points, and they can compare their recycling performance against other buildings by block, neighborhood or borough. Additionally, buildings and homeowners can set goals to reduce trash and increase recycling. 

              Municipalities benefit from understanding recycling behavior and volumes, and if their vehicles are outfitted with RFID readers they can verify that each bag scanned by a property manager or homeowner was actually thrown away.

            <a href="#panel3a">Why should we adopt recycle.it?</a>
            <div id="panel3a" class="content">
              recycle.it allows you to score points when users recycle.  This allows them to compete with their friends.  Commercial and residential buildings and homeowners should adopt Recycle It because it drives up the recycling rates and can help reduce their trash bill, avoid fines, and increase the value of their property.

            <a href="#panel4a">How are points scored?</a>
            <div id="panel4a" class="content">
              Points for recycling are assigned on a sliding scale based on the prevalence of the material and ease of recycling. For example, recycling paper or plastic is very easy whereas recycling electronics can be more difficult. Therefore, electronics have a higher point value. Similarly, recycling at home is easier than if you're outside your home. So recycling at a public recycling bins or a store earns more points.

            <div id="panel5a" class="content">
              Buildings earn points each time they scan special barcodes on their recycling bags. An equal number of points is assigned for each bag. We estimate the volume of a bag so there is no incentive to scan more bags.
